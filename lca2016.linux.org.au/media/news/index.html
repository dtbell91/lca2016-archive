<p>Intel Fellow and Vice President of Corporate Strategy at Intel, Australian-born Genevieve Bell leads a team of social scientists, interaction designers, human factors engineers and computer scientists whose mission is to build products in tune with people’s needs and desires. An industry expert and commentator on the intersection of culture and technology, she has published widely around the societal challenges facing us all as computing becomes ubiquitous. An accomplished anthropologist and researcher, Bell joined Intel in 1998. She has been granted a number of patents for consumer electronics innovations throughout her career, with additional patents in the user experience space pending, and is the author of numerous journal papers and articles. She was named an Intel Fellow in 2008.</p>

<p>In addition to her position at Intel, Bell is a highly regarded industry expert and frequent commentator on the intersection of culture and technology. She has been featured in publications such as Wired, Forbes, The Atlantic, Fast Company, the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times. She is also a sought-after public speaker and panelist at technology conferences worldwide for the insights she has gained from extensive international field work and research.
Her industry recognition includes being listed among the "100 Most Creative People in Business" by Fast Company in 2010, induction in the Women in Technology International Hall of Fame in 2012, and being honored as the 2013 Woman of Vision for Leadership by the Anita Borg Institute. Bell's book, "Divining a Digital Future: Mess and Mythology in Ubiquitous Computing," written in collaboration with Paul Dourish, was published by MIT Press in 2011.
Bell holds a combined bachelor's and master's degree in anthropology from Bryn Mawr College and a master's degree and Ph.D. in cultural anthropology from Stanford University, where she was a lecturer in the anthropology department from 1996 to 1998.</p>

<p>She is attributed with formalising user experience as a discipline, and ensuring that its practises are recognised as not just valuable, but vital, for ongoing technical success. </p>

<p>Conference 2IC and Speaker Liaison, Kathy Reid, was delighted to announce Ms Bell as one of four outstanding keynotes for linux.conf.au 2016. </p>

“As Linux moves from servers and desktops into embedded hardware, into the cloud, into mobile devices, the need for those products to be in affinity with user needs becomes ever more important. Genevieve’s area of practise is such a natural fit for our conference theme - Life is better with Linux - and we can’t wait to learn from Genevieve!”</p>

<p>One of the most respected technical conferences in Australia, Linux Conference Australia (linux.conf.au) will make Geelong home between 1st-5th February 2016. The conference is expected to attract over 500 national and international professional and hobbyist developers, technicians and innovative hardware specialists, and will feature nearly 100 Speakers and presentations over five days. Deakin University’s stunning Waterfront Campus will host the conference, leveraging state of the art networking and audio visual facilities. </p>

<p>The conference delivers Delegates a range of presentations and tutorials on topics such as open source hardware, open source operating systems and open source software, storage, containers and related issues such as patents, copyright and technical community development. </p>

<p>Linux is a computer operating system, in the same way that MacOS, Windows, Android and iOS are operating systems. It can be used on desktop computers, servers, and increasingly on mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. </p>

<p>Linux embodies the ‘open source’ paradigm of software development, which holds that source code – the code that is used to give computers and mobile devices functionality – should be ‘open’. That is, the source code should be viewable, modifiable and shareable by the entire community. There are a number of benefits to the open source paradigm, including facilitating innovation, sharing and re-use. The ‘open’ paradigm is increasingly extending to other areas such as open government, open culture, open health and open education.</p>

<p>Regional and rural technology advocate, Federation University Council Member, former lawyer and Chair of Internet Australia, George Fong, will be one of four outstanding keynotes for linux.conf.au in February 2016. Eminently respected within the region for his tireless efforts in advancing technology access, governance and inclusion, his advice and counsel is sought far and wide. </p>

<p>Most recently, Fong has been a driving force in the re-branding of the Internet Society of Australia into Internet Australia, transforming the organisation to be relevant and representative of a broad cross-section of Australians. </p>

<p>“Internet Australia is the peak body representing everyone who uses the Internet. Much of our work is dedicated to keeping the Internet as open and free from undue government interference as possible and seeing innovation thrive in the sector. It goes without saying that a significant part of that process is fuelled by the open source and Linux community.”</p>

<p>"There are new challenges in maintaining the integrity and utility of the Internet. Those challenges are redefining who we are in the technical community and what our roles and responsibilities are for communities and businesses nationally and internationally.”</p>

<p>Conference Director David Bell was thrilled to announce that Mr Fong would be keynoting. </p>

<p>“We’re delighted to be able to bring George’s considered wisdom, academic intellect and world view to linux.conf.au 2016 Geelong - LCA By the Bay. The need for well researched, inclusive and representative technology policies is more important than ever given the disruption the world faces in coming years”.</p>

<p>Open hardware luminary, TED Fellow and future materials industry leader, Catarina Mota, will be one of four outstanding keynotes for linux.conf.au in February 2016. Mota is co-founder of openMaterials.org - a project dedicated to furthering exploration of ‘smart materials’ - conductive ink, electronics that run off energy generated by the human body and new generations of plastics  that have memory. She recently founded Everywhere Tech - an organisation facilitating open source technology transfer to foster resilient communities around the world. </p>

<p>Her passion is to encourage the ‘maker’ in all of us - motivating a new generation’s interest in science, technology and collaboration. This passion extends to her current pursuits - doctoral academic research into the social impact of open and collaborative practices for the development of technologies. </p>

<p>"I'm very much looking forward to the wonderful LCA. Long before there was open source hardware/materials, there was open source software and Linux - I can't wait for the opportunity to learn from the community who paved the way for the rest of us."</p>

<p>Conference 2IC Kathy Reid was delighted to announce Ms Mota as Keynote Speaker. 

<p>“I first heard Catarina speak at LinuxCon Europe in Barcelona in 2012 and was simply awestruck. Her passion, her empathy, and sincere desire to make the world a better place through technology is so incredibly inspirational. Catarina’s work at the intersection of technology, collaboration and humanity is such a natural fit for linux.conf.au 2016’s theme of ‘Life is better with Linux’. We’re honoured to be able to welcome her to Geelong in February.”</p>

<p>One of the most respected technical conferences in Australia, Linux Conference Australia (linux.conf.au) will make Geelong home between 1st-5th February 2016. The conference is expected to attract over 500 national and international professional and hobbyist developers, technicians and innovative hardware specialists, and will feature nearly 100 Speakers and presentations over five days. Deakin University’s stunning Waterfront Campus will host the conference, leveraging state of the art networking and audio visual facilities. </p>

<p>The conference delivers Delegates a range of presentations and tutorials on topics such as open source hardware, open source operating systems and open source software, storage, containers and related issues such as patents, copyright and technical community development. 

<p>Linux is a computer operating system, in the same way that MacOS, Windows, Android and iOS are operating systems. It can be used on desktop computers, servers, and increasingly on mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. </p>

<p>Newly-appointed Director of Community at GitHub, Jono Bacon, will be one of four outstanding keynotes for linux.conf.au in February 2016. Bacon, formerly Community Manager at Canonical - the company behind Linux distribution Ubuntu, and author of the best-selling ‘The Art of Community’, will deliver insights into building strong, effective, diverse and successful technical communities. </p>

<p>Bacon shared his enthusiasm for keynoting linux.conf.au. “I am absolutely delighted to be joining you all in Geelong in 2016. LCA is a cornerstone in the global Linux and Open Source movement and I am not only excited about speaking but also getting to know all the attendees at the event”, Bacon says.</p>

<p>Conference Director, David Bell, was thrilled to announce Mr Bacon as Keynote Speaker. </p>

<p>“Our theme for linux.conf.au 2016 is ‘Life is better with Linux’ - and the strength of our Linux and open source communities contribute significantly to that aspiration. Robust, diverse, and inclusive communities happen by design, not accident, and Jono has done an enormous amount to shape that. It’s truly an honour to be able to host him in Geelong in February.”</p>

linux.conf.au 2016, in partnership with Optiver, are very proud to announce our diversity programme for 2016!

LCA2016 and Optiver are proud to be able to support diversity in our community. The Optiver Diversity Programme is intended to ensure that linux.conf.au continues to be a safe, open, and welcoming conference for everyone.  Together with Optiver the programme has been developed to assist delegates from under-represented cohorts who contribute to the Open Source community but, without financial assistance, would not be able to attend LCA2016.
